Morse code was developed by American inventor Samuel Morse and Alfred
Vail in 1830s. Samuel morse invented an electric telegraph while Vail improved on
Morse’s original design making it simpler which now is known as morse code. What is
called Morse code today is somewhat different from what was originally developed by
Vail and Morse. The Modern International Morse code, or continental code, was
created by Friedrich Clemens Gerke in 1848. After some minor changes, International
Morse Code was standardized at the International Telegraphy Congress in 1865 in Paris
and was later made the standard by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
Morse code is a method used to encode text characters as standardized
sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes. Morse Code is used
for representing letters of the alphabet, numerals etc by an arrangement of dots, dashes,
and spaces. The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths or analogous
mechanical or visual signals, such as flashing lights (led).
Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dots/dits and dashes/dahs.
The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The
duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. Each dot or dash within an
encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space, equal to
the dot duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to
three dots, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dots.
The most well-known code phrase is ‘SOS’. ‘SOS’ is widely recognised as a
distress signal as it is easier to remember. Why? Because in International Morse Code,
"S" is three dots and "O" is three dashes. Therefore, SOS in morse code is as follows:
"dot-dot-dot-dash-dash-dash-dot-dot-dot" (...---...).
